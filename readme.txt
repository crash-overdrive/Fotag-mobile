Hello,
Welcome to the mobile version of Fotag! This is a simple Android image gallery developed on Android Studio 3.1.3 in Windows 10 using the in built Java 8 which comes with Android Studio. The app was built for Phones and Tablets with atleast Android 8.0 (Oreo) with an API support of atleast level 26.
For personal testing purposes i used a Pixel (Google Phone) AVD using API 26.

The app supports both Potrait and Landscape Orientation and changes its view accordingly. Clicking on the load button will load the 10 default images, which you can rate or unrate. You can then filter these images from the toolbar included at the top. I hope i get image addition done in time as well :) 

I hope you enjoy using my app!
